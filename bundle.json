    "description" : "Whenever a media server publishing a HLS stream has not started publishing an event  or if it fails with an error such as 404, the client/player does not get a valid manifest and the client/player needs to have a logic in place to show a graceful error message to the viewer or call a backup url. With this Akamai edgeworker script, no clientside/player changes needed, the CDN will automatically provide a backup playback manifest which plays backup content such as Ads, trailers, countdown, retry message etc.",
